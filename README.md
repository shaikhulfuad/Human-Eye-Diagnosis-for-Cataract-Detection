# Human-Eye-Diagnosis-for-Cataract-Detection


Cataracts are one of the most common visual problems and it affects people as they grow older and lose their vision. A cataract is a cloud that forms on the lens of our eyes and it is caused by a buildup of debris. Among the most noticeable signs of this illness are blurred vision, faded colors and difficulties seeing in bright light. It is common for these symptoms to result in trouble doing a number of duties. Therefore, early cataract detection and prevention may aid in reducing the rate of blindness in the population. On the basis of a publicly available image dataset, we hope to recognize cataract eye disease using convolutional neural networks. As part of this experiment, six alternative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) meta-architectures, including NetInceptionV3, XceptionNet,MobileNet, EfficientNetV2B1, EfficientNetV2B0 and DenseNet121 were applied to the TensorFlow object detection framework, with each architecture being represented by a different color.

# Problem Statement
In the event that Cataract is not detected and treated in its early stages, it has the potential to cause full blindness of the eye. Based on the information our objective is to develop a categorization model that may assist in determining whether or not a person had Cataract. The pictures acquired by the Fundus camera are used as input for the model.
